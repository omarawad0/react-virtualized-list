# React Virtualized List

This is a React application demonstrating a virtualized table implementation. The app uses Vite and TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (for managing dependencies)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omarawad0/react-virtualized-list.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd react-virtualized-list
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Use npm or yarn to install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using yarn
yarn install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the Vite development server:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# OR using yarn
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

### 5. Build for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run build

# OR using yarn
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be available in the `dist` directory.

### 6. Preview the Production Build

```bash
# Using npm
npm run preview

# OR using yarn
yarn preview
```

This will start a local server to preview the build.
